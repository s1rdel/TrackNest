TrackNest

TrackNest is a simple full-stack web application built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js).
The goal of this project is to provide a personal music library where users can register, log in, and manage their own collection of tracks, albums, and artists.

Features
    User registration with name, phone, address, email, and password.
    Login system (mocked for now, later secured with Passport.js).
    Library screen displaying a list of tracks, albums, and artists with:
    Ratings (★ 1–5)
    Personal notes
    Edit / Delete options
    Responsive design with Bootstrap 5 (works on desktop & mobile).
    Footer and navigation bar for a clean layout.
    Currently implemented as static pages (UI only) without database logic — backend and database integration will be added later.

Pages
    Register – form with extended details (name, phone, address, email, password).
    Login – centered login form with modern design.
    Library – main data page showing sample music items in card format.
